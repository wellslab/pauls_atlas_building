## Folder structure

You can change the subfolders in this project in any way you want, but for beginners, the current structure is recommended to deal with most situations in various projects. This template comes with example folders and files to get you started.

* howtos/

    Contains notes you can keep as you discover tricks and work out how to do tasks (markdown format makes it easier to read on the website directly).

* notebooks/

    Jupyter notebooks are placed here. If there are many notebooks in a big project, it's useful to create subfolders here too (eg. 0_Initial_analysis/, 1_Clustering/). For tips on how to version control jupyter notebooks, see howtos/ManagingNotebooks.md.

    Output files from notebooks can be placed in subfolders within notebooks/. This actually makes it easy to identify which output files were produced by which notebooks. These output files can then be shared with collaborators.

* received/

    Contains data files which often act as inputs to programs you write. These may be downloaded from websites or received by email. Subfolders here can be used to distinguish the different sources. For example, we may want to have a subfolder called "GEO" here for files downloaded from GEO website, and another called "Paul" for files received from Paul. It's good practise to record where each file came from, as this can easily be forgotten later and it can put much work downstream in doubt when you're not sure where the input files originate.
